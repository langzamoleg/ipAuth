
# ipAuth

simple spigot authentication plugin


## installation

just download latest release [here](https://github.com/langzamoleg/ipAuth/releases/) and drop it to your server `/plugins/` folder

    
## how it works

when someone is joining your server plugin does something of this:
- **if** player joins server for the first time plugin saves his ip ðŸ‘€
- **if** this player had played on your server and ips is diffirent new ip will be banned ðŸ”¨
- **if** this player had played and ips is equal nothing happens ðŸ¥°

**you can always use banlist and pardon-ip to remove incorrect ban**
